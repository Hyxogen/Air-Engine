# Air Engine
Welcome to the Air Engine github page! Air Engine is a game engine with which I aim to learn more about C++, 3D graphics programming, and everything surrounding it. Currently not much is implemented but I have big goals for this engine!

## Contribute
First of all thank you so much for wanting to contribute to this project of mine. If you find any bugs/typos feel free to create pull requests fixing those. However, as I'm aiming to learn more about 3D graphics programming with this project so I'm currently not accepting pull requests for features and the like.

## Bugs/Features
If you feel like a feature is missing do not hesitate to create an issue for it.
